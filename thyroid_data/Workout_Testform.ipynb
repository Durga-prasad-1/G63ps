            "\n",
            "1. Include iodine-rich foods: Consuming foods high in iodine is essential for individuals with compensated hypothyroidism. Some iodine-rich options include seaweed, cod, shrimp, dairy products, and iodized salt. Iodine is necessary for the production of thyroid hormones, so it is important to ensure adequate intake.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Limit goitrogenic foods: Goitrogens are substances that can interfere with thyroid function when consumed in large amounts. These foods include cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts. While it is important to eat a variety of vegetables, it is recommended to cook these goitrogenic vegetables to reduce their impact on thyroid function.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Maintain balanced nutrition: It is crucial to maintain a balanced and nutritious diet to support overall health and thyroid function. Focus on consuming a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid excessive consumption of processed foods, refined sugars, and saturated fats. Opt for nutrient-dense foods that provide vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to support thyroid health.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. Regular aerobic exercise: Engaging in regular aerobic exercise is beneficial for individuals with compensated hypothyroidism. Activities like brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, or dancing can help boost metabolism, improve cardiovascular health, and maintain a healthy body weight. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Strength training: Incorporating strength training exercises into your routine can help increase muscle mass and improve overall strength. This can help support a healthy metabolism and promote weight management. Include exercises like weightlifting, resistance band workouts, or bodyweight exercises. Aim for two to three strength training sessions per week, targeting different muscle groups.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Flexibility exercises: Stretching and flexibility exercises are essential to maintain joint mobility and prevent stiffness. Incorporate activities like yoga, Pilates, or stretching routines into your exercise routine. These exercises can help improve flexibility, posture, and overall physical well-being.\n",
